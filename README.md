# Mobylette

Docker for the 2020s.

This repo contains a modern Docker engine built on-top of containerd that is ready for 2020 and beyond.

Mobylette is a containerd plugin to expose a fully compatible [Moby API 1.41](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/)
, making it a viable alternative to moby/docker engine for those who install a daemon from scratch.
